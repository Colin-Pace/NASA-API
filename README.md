The NASA-API app is a single-page web application that allows users to view the NASA picture of the day and to search for a list of near Earth asteroids. The application uses the fetch technology for the API from NASA. React is used to display the results of the fetch. React Router provides the navigation between the home page that displays the picture of the day and the page that enables a user to search for near Earth asteroids. The result of the search is a list of the names of the asteroids. To search, use the drop down calendar menus to select a start and end date that are within seven days of each other. The application is best viewed with a width of about 1280 pixels.
